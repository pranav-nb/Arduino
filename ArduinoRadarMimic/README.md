# ArduinoBasedRadarMimic

## Abstract:
Radar is an object detection system. It uses radio waves to primarily determine the position of objects. An ultrasonic sensor is used to produce waves and trace them back. Different hardware devices like Arduino UNO, HC-SR04, SG-90, Piezo buzzer are used to implement this project. The ultrasonic sensor transmits ultrasonic waves which bounce off any object in their path and again sensed back. The distance and time utilised in this operation is used to predict the position of that object. The movement of the sensor is controlled with the help of a servo motor. A buzzer is used to alert if an object is detected within a specified range. The data received is processed with the help of a python code to provide a graphical representation. 

## Components used:
### Hardware:  
Arduino UNO (microcontroller), HC-SR04 (ultrasonic sensor), SG-90 (servo motor), Grove Piezo Buzzer v1.2(buzzer)     
### Software:  
Arduino IDE, PyCharm or any other IDE for Python3, Proteus 8(Optional)
